# Your turn now: increase the availability of your application!


## 1) Add Scaling to Your Projects

Do _either_ of the following:

  1. Create a high-availability setup with a _hot_ and _standby_ server for your _ITU-MiniTwit_ application. In such a setup you would have two replica of your application server where only one is ever active at a time, i.e., no load balancer in front of either of them.
  The setup should resemble [the one discussed in the lecture](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-highly-available-web-servers-with-keepalived-and-floating-ips-on-ubuntu-14-04).

Or: 

  2. Create a Docker Swarm cluster for your _ITU-MiniTwit_ applications in which various components run as services and can be scaled as needed. Note, very likely you do not want to scale you DB servers horizontally (to keep your data consistent) but only all the services 'in front' of it.

## 1.b) (Optional) Measure your downtime when migrating to the swarm
- How much time is your system down? Stopwatch measurement is fine. Ideally zero downtime should be achievable if you don't have to move your database. 
- A brief description (half a page to one page) of how you ensured a low downtime during this transition should be part of your final report 

## 2) Update Strategy

Implement an automatic update strategy in your build chain. Choose either rolling updates or blue-green. 

## 3) Add an Availability View to your Monitoring Dashboard

Add at least the following to your Grafana dashboard:
- **Service health** — is each service up or down (based on a health check endpoint)
- **HTTP success rate** — percentage of non-5xx responses over time
- **Response time** — P95 latency (the response time that 95% of requests are faster than) for at least your key API endpoints (e.g., the simulator endpoints)
Show these over the last week and last month.

**Bonus**: set up an **alert** (e.g., in Grafana or via a Slack webhook) that notifies you when availability drops below a threshold.





## 4) Software Maintenance


We are in software maintenance. That is, fix issues of your version of _ITU-MiniTwit_ **as soon as possible**. Let's say that as soon as possible means within 24 hours if possible, i.e., if it is not a super big issue that requires a big rewrite. 

Now, with your monitoring and logging systems in place, you will likely observe issues when they arise or even before the arise. Just fix them as soon as you realize them.

Continue to release (now likely automatically) at least once per week versions of your system with corresponding fixes.
